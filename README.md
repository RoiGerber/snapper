This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

COMMITING:

git add .
git commit -m "Fix ESLint errors"
git push origin main



RUN:
cd C:\Users\roige\Desktop\books-site\my-next-app
npm run dev


Event Status:

1) "submitted" – The client posts an event (not paid yet).
2) "paid" – The client enters credit card credentials for the event.
3) "accepted" – The photographer accepts the event.
4) "uploaded" – The photographer marks the event as completed after uploading all photos.

Notes:

- In the marketplace, photographers can only see events with the status "paid."
- The client's payment is processed in the background when the event status changes to "accepted."
- The payment to the photographer is done manually after they mark the event as "uploaded."

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
